# About
The “Toastrack” is a 1929 vintage [Dennis][dennis-society] bus owned by the Southampton University Engineering Society (SUES) since 1958 and driven and maintained by students and staff of the university. It still sees regular use and you can even book it for your event. If you are a student or graduate of the University of Southampton, then you are welcome to become part of the team that looks after her.
